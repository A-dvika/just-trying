Hi Ruschi,

I hope you’re doing well. My name is Advika Thakur, and I’m a Summer Analyst in the Workplace Engineering team, Engineering Division. I’m currently working on the UI uplift for the NDS portal, which will support both Windows 11 and NDS.Next migrations.

I would like to set up a brief call with Anand Gupta to discuss my internship progress and get his insights on a few topics related to the portal work. Could you please help coordinate a time that fits Anand’s availability over the next week or so? I am flexible and can adjust to his schedule.

Thank you for your assistance. Please let me know if there’s any information you need from me to facilitate the scheduling.

Best regards,

🔹 Why this topic?
Most people know LLMs are powerful, but don’t know how they can talk to your documents. This session demystifies that and shows practical use cases for enterprises.

🧠 Key Talking Points:

What is RAG? (LLM + Vector DB + Search = Smart Assistant)

Why LLMs hallucinate & how RAG fixes it

Components: Embeddings, Vector Search, Document Store

Tools: OpenAI + Pinecone / FAISS / LangChain

Real-life use cases:

AI chatbots that answer from internal docs

Search engines for custom data (e.g., policy docs, product manuals)

Personalized recommendation with hybrid search


Quick walkthrough of how a RAG pipeline looks (just the flow)
