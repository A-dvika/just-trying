Perfect — a 30-minute intern-led session should be engaging, informative, and leave a smart impression without being overly technical. Here’s a concise proposal + solid talking points for each topic:


---

✅ Topic 1: "RAG: Powering LLMs with Real-World Knowledge"

📌 Session Proposal Title:

> “RAG in Action: How ChatGPT Can Learn from Your Notes, PDFs & Google”



🔹 Why this topic?
Most people know LLMs are powerful, but don’t know how they can talk to your documents. This session demystifies that and shows practical use cases for enterprises.

🧠 Key Talking Points:

What is RAG? (LLM + Vector DB + Search = Smart Assistant)

Why LLMs hallucinate & how RAG fixes it

Components: Embeddings, Vector Search, Document Store

Tools: OpenAI + Pinecone / FAISS / LangChain

Real-life use cases:

AI chatbots that answer from internal docs

Search engines for custom data (e.g., policy docs, product manuals)

Personalized recommendation with hybrid search


Quick walkthrough of how a RAG pipeline looks (just the flow)

✅ Topic 2: "CLIP: How Vision Meets Language in AI"

📌 Session Proposal Title:

> “How AI Understands Memes: Vision-Language Models like CLIP”



🔹 Why this topic?
It’s visual, intuitive, and surprises people. CLIP bridges text and image understanding — very cool to see in action.
