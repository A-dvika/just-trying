What to Say in Your Meeting
"Good morning/afternoon, everyone.

Here's my update on the UI enhancement for the NDS portal's schedule migration:

What I've completed: I've finished writing the UI code for the schedule migration page. I've also successfully integrated the search and system selection functionality.

What's next: My immediate focus is on integrating the migration schedule itself. I anticipate completing this in the coming days.

Looking ahead: In preparation for the next steps, I've started reading up on test writing, CI/CD, and MSH.

That's all from my end. I'm on track with the task."
